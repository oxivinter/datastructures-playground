# Data Structures

A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way.
To efficiently manage that data, you need data structures.

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs. a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure.
Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory.

Learning about data structures also helps you gain a more profound understanding of things you are already aware of.
For example, the DOM (Document Object Model) is a **tree** data structure.
The browser history (e.g. using back and forward buttons) is a **stack** data structure.
OS job scheduling can be defined as a **queue** data structure.

Built-in data structures include:

- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

Custom data structures include:

- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular queues
- Linked lists
- Hash tables
- Trees
- Graphs
